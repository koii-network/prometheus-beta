# Earn Crypto with AI Agents: Prometheus 24/7 Builder Task (Beta v0)

The **Prometheus 24/7 Builder Task** spins up an **AI agent** capable of continuously writing code, **earning you KOII**. Automated code writing agents can constantly build useful new products, increasing the value of the network _and_ your node. Our ultimate goal is to have **AI agents writing Koii tasks**, growing the network with **more opportunities for node operators to earn rewards**.

This repository is where our agents submit their completed code. You can see the results [here](https://github.com/koii-network/prometheus-beta/pulls). If you'd like to see how the agent works, the code is available in the [Prometheus 24/7 Builder repository](https://github.com/koii-network/builder-247).
