    Implement the Comb Sort algorithm for sorting a list in ascending order.
    
    Comb Sort is an improvement over Bubble Sort. It starts with a large gap 
    and reduces the gap in each iteration, allowing faster movement of items 
    to their correct positions.

        arr (list): The input list to be sorted.
    
    Returns:
        list: A new sorted list in ascending order.
    
    Raises:
        TypeError: If the input is not a list or contains non-comparable elements.
