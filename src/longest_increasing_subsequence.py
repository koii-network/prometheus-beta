def find_longest_increasing_subsequence(arr):
    """
    Find the longest increasing subsequence in the given array.
    
    A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting 
    some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
    
    Args:
        arr (list): Input list of comparable elements
    
    Returns:
        list: The longest increasing subsequence
    
    Raises:
        TypeError: If the input is not a list
        ValueError: If the input list contains elements that cannot be compared
    
    Time Complexity: O(n^2)
    Space Complexity: O(n)
    
    Examples:
        >>> find_longest_increasing_subsequence([10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80])
        [10, 22, 33, 50, 60, 80]
        >>> find_longest_increasing_subsequence([])
        []
        >>> find_longest_increasing_subsequence([5])
