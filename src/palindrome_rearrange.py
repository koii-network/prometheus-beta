    """
    Determine if the characters in the given string can be rearranged to form a palindrome.

    A palindrome can be formed if at most one character has an odd count, 
    and all other characters have even counts.

    Args:
        s (str): Input string to check for palindrome rearrangement possibility

    Returns:
        bool: True if the string can be rearranged to form a palindrome, False otherwise

    Examples:
        >>> can_form_palindrome("racecar")
        True
        >>> can_form_palindrome("code")
        False
