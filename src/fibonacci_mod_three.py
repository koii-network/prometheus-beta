def generate_modified_fibonacci(n):

    Generate a modified Fibonacci sequence up to a given number with a special divisibility constraint.
    
    The sequence starts with [1, 1] and modifies subsequent numbers so that the sum of any two 
    consecutive numbers (starting from the third number) is always divisible by 3.
    
    Args:
        n (int): The maximum number of elements in the sequence to generate.
    
    Returns:
        list: A modified Fibonacci sequence satisfying the divisibility constraint.

        ValueError: If the input is not a positive integer.
