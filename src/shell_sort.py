    Implement the Shell Sort algorithm for sorting a list of comparable elements.
    
    Shell Sort is an in-place comparison sorting algorithm that improves on bubble sort 
    and insertion sort by using a decreasing sequence of gap sizes to move elements.
    
    Args:
        arr (list): The input list to be sorted in-place.
    
    Returns:
        list: The sorted list (same object as input, modified in-place).
    
    Raises:
        TypeError: If the input is not a list or contains non-comparable elements.
