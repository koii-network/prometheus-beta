def shell_sort(arr):
    """
    Implement the Shell sort algorithm for sorting a list of comparable elements.

    Shell sort is an optimization of insertion sort that allows the exchange of 
    elements that are far apart, reducing the amount of shifting required.

    Args:
        arr (list): The input list to be sorted in-place.

    Returns:
        list: The sorted list.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If the input is not a list.
        ValueError: If the list contains elements that cannot be compared.
